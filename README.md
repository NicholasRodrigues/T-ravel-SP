# Requirements
### Understanding TSP
  - Research about TSP and implement a simple model that finds the best possible path between capitals.
  - Linear Programming and Combinatorial Optimization are a must.

### Expanding the solution:
  - **Multi-Objective**: cost, time, environment, weather.
  - **Dynamic Conditions**: road closures, fuel costs, traffic.
  - **Vehicle Capacity**: time windows, delivery quantities(VRP).

### Libraries:
  - OpenMP, MPI.
  - Ant Colony Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization.
  - ML based on historical data
  - Qt, OpenGL, SFML.
  - Gurobi or CPLEX

### Google Maps or OpenStreetMap
